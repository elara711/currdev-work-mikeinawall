#### 1. What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
    Intro to Computer Science
    Grade Level: 9-12, 
    Student Experience: Block based coding in Middle School on Scratch. 
#### 2. What is the language?
    Javascript
#### 3. How does one write & run code in this language?
    This is a text based coding language which code. Depending on the platform you are using code may need to compile before running or just run. 
#### 4. Rate the complexity of the syntax?
    I would rate the syntax as moderate in complexity for a high school coding language. The key words are mostily full engilsh words. 
    
#### 5. Strengths
    Can start coding right away 
    To print to an output line does not require print statments 
    Formatting is translatable to other coding languages like Python and Java
#### 6. How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
    I would use the strengths of the language to design projects that highlight the nuances of coding languages which is the goal of an intro coding class. Things like variable types, function calling and work with strings can all coded quickly and be used to gain understanding of those topics
#### 7. Weaknesses
    Depending on the software used to work on this language with students the debugging process may be difficult. Some other coding languages and playforms allow for visual representations of the process the computer uses to read and interpret code which would definitely be beneficial in an intro ro computer science class
#### 8. How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
    To address the difficulty of the debugging process I would emphasize strategies for reading and analyzing code to identify errors. Daily Do Nows would be code samples where students need to identify the error in a code and later in the year what kind of error would be generated. 
#### 9. Why did you select this language for this class?
    I selected this language for my Intro class becasue of its relatively simple nature for the beginning concepts of a coding language. This language does a good job of initially introducing very simple and fundamental syntax that students can quickly take to. Spending time on the basics with that syntax will better prepare students for the more complex concepts later in an intro type class and will make applying syntax to the more complex concepts easier.
