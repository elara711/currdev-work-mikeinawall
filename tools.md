# Tools
## Tool #1: Visual Studio
#### General Purpose:
Visual Studio is used as the space for students to code in class by first desgning a form which will function as a space to allow user input to execute code
#### The class I use it in: 
Intro to Computer Science

#### How you use it in class?
Visual Studio is a good platform to Introduce Visual basic as an Introductory coding language because it allows students to drag and drop objects and edit object properties without coding. 

#### Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
I use the tool for coding becuase students do not need to code the placing and properties of the objects an can instead focus on the computer science principles using said objects and properties. 

## Tool #2: Google Classroom

Online Learning Platform, posting assignments and notes
#### The class I use it in:

#### How you use it in class:
I use classroom to post the slides that I use when lecturing so that students can refer back to the notes when working on projects. I also post do now and non coding classwork assignments so that students can submit them for grading easily. I also post each set of projects with their respective bonus assignments on classroom for students to easily access them
#### Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
Google Classroom is used in my school as the main online learning platform and it does function well for the purposes I use it for. I also like it because of the student comfort level using it coming into the class.
