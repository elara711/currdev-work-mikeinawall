# Two Assignments for the unit plan

## Assignment #1: Letter Count Project
Description: The goal of this project is to review the topics of strings and how to work with them as well as loops and conditionals to create code that will iterate through a string and determine the number of times a specific character appears in that string. This project will be the first of a few larger projects in the sequence and the goal is to demonstrate how to organize your thoughts for an assingment before coding. The first day will be completely designated to creating the assingment and talking through how to organize in advance what you want your code to do. 

Student Facing instructions: 
1. Teacher will demo finished version of working code and students will think pair and share the answers to the following questions.
   a) What objects will be created for the project
   b) which object and action will be the event for the code
   c) In your own word describe the what will the project do
   d) What variables should we create and what should they represent
3. Based on the discussion from the provious questions students will indivisdually create all of the objects in their respective forms and then as a class we will generate the pseudo code only for the assingment
   (End of day 1)
5. At the start of the second day students will be asked to reopen their projects and begin filling in their pseudo with the code for the project
6. #### Challenge
   As an additional challenge students will be asked to modify their code to identify the number of words by using the number of spaces in the sentence
8. At the end of the second day a students will demo their version of the code for others. 

 ## Assingment #2: Letter Grade 
   Description: This project will be the third and is meant as an attainable larger project that students first work on individually. Like the other the students will be given a specific prompt for the project and teacher driven demo of a working version. This project is to be completed individually but will be scaffolded.

Student Facing Instructions: 

1.  Teacher will demo finished version of working code. Students will also be handed a planning page with a description
   - Create a form which take a number as a user input and when the letter grade button is clicked will reveal the letter grade for that score in a new window. The user should be unable to enter an invalid score. An A is a score 90 or higher, B a score 80 or higher, C is a score 70 or Higher, D is a score 60 or higher and any score lower than a 60 is an F.
2.  Students will first complete the planning page which will guide them through an outline of the project the questions on the planning page will be as follows
  - What objects will be in the form
  - What are the minimum and maximum valid score that can be entered
  - What are the conditional that would prevent a user from entering an invalid scores
  - How will you format the condition for each of the letter grades? Explain the reason for your choice.
3. Students must have their planning page checked with a partner and checked by teacher before beginning project.
4. Once a student has completed the planning page they will first write in pseudo code for the steps of the project based on the planning page and then complete the code.
5. At the end of the second day students will be placed in small groups of 3-4 to present their work to each other. The goal of their discussion is specifically to discuss the similarities and differences of their conditional structure.
